# Refactoring task

## Run locally

1. Install php 8.2
2. Install composer
3. Run `composer install`
4. For app just `php app.php input.txt`
5. For tests `vendor/bin/phpunit tests`

Or you can check it on GitHub Codspaces or in your VS Code

## Note on URLs of APIs
Both URLs from the original code were replaced, because:
- The API for checking card by bin has very strict rate limit.
- The API for exchange rate requires an account
